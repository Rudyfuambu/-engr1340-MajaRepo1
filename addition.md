How the addition of two integers works 
When you add two integers, you are combining their values based on direction and size.

Think of integers like movement on a number line:
	•	Positive numbers move right.
	•	Negative numbers move left.

So when you add, you start at the first number and move according to the second number.

Example:
-7 + 4

Start at −7.
Adding +4 means move 4 units to the right.
You land on −3.

This works because the positive 4 cancels out 4 of the 7 negative units, leaving 3 negative units.

So adding integers is really about:
	•	Combining amounts
	•	Canceling opposites
	•	Moving left or right on the number line

	Example 2 :

6 + (-9)

Start at 6 on the number line.
Adding −9 means move 9 units to the left.

When you move 9 steps left from 6, you pass 0 and land on −3.

So,

6 + (-9) = -3

This works because the 6 positive units cancel out 6 of the 9 negative units, leaving 3 negative units left.
